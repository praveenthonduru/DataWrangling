# Univariate Analysis
Quality of wine

As we can see the entire wine quality are in the range of 3 to 8 with the most common values are 5 and 6 and the least common values are 3, 4, 7, and 8. So, we create another variable rating with rate given below.

    0 - 4 : poor
    5 - 6 : good
    7 - 10 : ideal
    
```{r}
rw$rating <- ifelse(rw$quality < 5, 'poor', ifelse(
  rw$quality < 7, 'good', 'ideal'))

rw$rating <- ordered(rw$rating, levels = c('poor', 'good', 'ideal'))
summary(rw$rating)

ggplot(data = rw, aes(x = as.factor(rating), fill = rating)) +
  geom_bar() +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_brewer(type = 'seq', palette = 2)
```
#Summary of rating:

```{r}
summary(rw$rating)
```

##Calculate total acidity
To calculate sum of all acids in the red wines, we create a new variable called total.acidity.
```{r}
rw$total.acidity <- rw$fixed.acidity + rw$volatile.acidity + rw$citric.acid

head(rw$total.acidity)
```
##Distribution and Outliers

    fixed.acidity, volatile.acidity, sulfur.dioxide, sulphated and alcohol are appeared to be long tailed.
    density and pH are normally distributed with few outliers.
    residual.sugar and chlorides have extreme outliers.
    citric.acid contains large number of zero values.
    
##Plot base 10 logarithmic scale of the long tailed distribution

```{r}
ggplot(data = rw, aes(x = fixed.acidity)) +
  geom_histogram() + 
  scale_x_log10() +
  xlab('fixed.acidity (g / dm^3)')

ggplot(data = rw, aes(x = volatile.acidity)) +
  geom_histogram() + 
  scale_x_log10() +
  xlab('volatile.acidity (g / dm^3)')

ggplot(data = rw, aes(x = free.sulfur.dioxide)) +
  geom_histogram() + 
  scale_x_log10() +
  xlab('free.sulfur.dioxide (mg / dm^3)')

ggplot(data = rw, aes(x = total.sulfur.dioxide)) +
  geom_histogram() + 
  scale_x_log10() +
  xlab('total.sulfur.dioxide (mg / dm^3)')

ggplot(data = rw, aes(x = sulphates)) +
  geom_histogram() + 
  scale_x_log10() +
  xlab('sulphates (g / dm^3)')

ggplot(data = rw, aes(x = alcohol)) +
  geom_histogram() + 
  scale_x_log10() +
  xlab('alcohol (% volume)')
```
#Taking log_10, we can see that fixed.acidity, volatile.acidity, and sulphates are normally distributed, with some few outliers.

## Find number of zeroes in citric.acid

```{r}
length(subset(rw, citric.acid == 0)$citric.acid)
```
We found that 132 observations have zero values.

##Find some patterns in residual.sugar and chlorides after removing some extreme outliers
```{r}
ggplot(data = rw, aes(x = residual.sugar)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  scale_x_continuous(lim = c(0.5, quantile(rw$residual.sugar, 0.95))) +
  xlab('residual.sugar (g / dm^3)')

ggplot(data = rw, aes(x = chlorides)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  scale_x_continuous(lim = c(0.04, quantile(rw$chlorides, 0.95))) +
  xlab('chlorides (g / dm^3)')
```
##Correlation between residual.sugar and chlorides :

```{r}
cor.test(rw$residual.sugar, rw$chlorides)
```

    After removing some extreme outliers, we see chlorides are now normally distributed
    Since residual.sugar comes in wide range as, it is rare to find wines with less than 1 gm/liter and wines with greater than 45 gm/liter are considered sweet, so the range of 1 - 4 as we found in the plot are ok with some outliers.


> **Tip**: Now that you've completed your univariate explorations, it's time to
reflect on and summarize what you've found. Use the questions below to help you
gather your observations and add your own if you have other thoughts!

### What is the structure of your dataset?
There are 1,599 red wines in the dataset with 11 features on the chemical properties of the wine. ( fixed.acidity, volatile.acidity, citric.acid, residual.sugar, chlorides, free.sulfur.dioxide, total.sulfur.dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, and quality).

Other observations:

The median quality is 6. Most wines have a pH of 3.4 or higher. About 75% of wine have quality that is lower than 6. The median percent alcohol content is 10.20 and the max percent alcohol content is 14.90.

### What is/are the main feature(s) of interest in your dataset?
The main features in the data set are pH and quality. I'd like to determine which features are best for predicting the quality of a wine. I suspect pH and some combination of the other variables can be used to build a predictive model to grade the quality of wines.

### What other features in the dataset do you think will help support your \investigation into your feature(s) of interest?
density and pH are also normally distributed as our new variable rating. So, these two can help support our analysis.

### Did you create any new variables from existing variables in the dataset?
I created an ordered factor rating, level each variables as 'poor', 'good' and 'ideal'.
And, total.acidity to calculate sum of all acids.

### Of the features you investigated, were there any unusual distributions? \Did you perform any operations on the data to tidy, adjust, or change the form \of the data? If so, why did you do this?
Having visualized acitric acid and volatile acidity data, I observed some unusual distributions, so I guess this fact may have some correlation with the quality of red wine. Since the data is clean, I did not perform any cleaning process or modification of the data.

# Bivariate Plots Section

> **Tip**: Based on what you saw in the univariate plots, what relationships
between variables might be interesting to look at in this section? Don't limit
yourself to relationships between a main output feature and one of the
supporting variables. Try to look at relationships between supporting variables
as well.

##Let's see some relationships between some variable and total.acidity

```{r}
ggplot(data = rw, aes(log10(total.acidity), density)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 1/10) +
  scale_x_continuous() +
  geom_smooth() +
  xlab('log10[total.acidity (g / dm^3)]') +
  ylab('density (g / dm^3)')

ggplot(data = rw, aes(log10(total.acidity), pH)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 1/10) +
  scale_x_continuous() +
  geom_smooth() +
  xlab('log10[total.acidity (g / dm^3)]')
```
##We see that there is approx. linear relationship between density and log10(total.acidity), and pH and log10(total.acidity).

# Bivariate Analysis

> **Tip**: As before, summarize what you found in your bivariate explorations
here. Use the questions below to guide your discussion.

### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the \investigation. How did the feature(s) of interest vary with other features in \the dataset?

poor rating seems to have following trends:

    lower fixed.acidity, higher volatile.acidity and lower citric.acid
    lower sulfur.dioxide and sulphates
    higher pH and high density

good rating seems to have following trends:

    low fixed.acidity and volatile.acidity
    higher sulfur.dioxide
    low pH and higher density

ideal rating seems to have following trends:

    higher fixed.acidity , lower volatile.acidity and higher citric.acid
    low sulfur.dioxide and higher sulphates
    lower pH and density


### Did you observe any interesting relationships between the other features \(not the main feature(s) of interest)?
residual sugar is not correlated with rating but positively related with quality.

### What was the strongest relationship you found?
Following variables show strong correlations with quality
    alcohol
    sulphates
    citric.acid
    fixed.acidity


# Multivariate Plots Section

> **Tip**: Now it's time to put everything together. Based on what you found in
the bivariate plots section, create a few multivariate plots to investigate
more complex interactions between variables. Make sure that the plots that you
create here are justified by the plots you explored in the previous section. If
you plan on creating any mathematical models, this is the section where you
will do that.

# Multivariate Analysis

```{r}
ggplot(data = rw, aes(pH, alcohol, color = as.factor(quality))) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~rating) +
  ylab('alcohol (% volume)') +
  theme_dark() +
  scale_color_brewer(type = 'seq', palette = 1)

  ylab('fixed.acid (g / dm^3)')  +
  scale_color_brewer(type = 'seq', palette = 4) +
  theme_dark()
```



### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the \investigation. Were there features that strengthened each other in terms of \looking at your feature(s) of interest?

I plot graph between four variables citric.acid, fixed.acidity, sulphates and alcohol which shown high correlations with quality and faceted them with rating. I conclude that higher citric.acid and lower fixed.acidity yields better wines. Better wines also have higher alcohol and sulphates and lower pH.

### Were there any interesting or surprising interactions between features?

citric.acid and fixed.acid graph surprised me with linear model.

### OPTIONAL: Did you create any models with your dataset? Discuss the \strengths and limitations of your model.

# Final Plots and Summary

> **Tip**: You've done a lot of exploration and have built up an understanding
of the structure of and relationships between the variables in your dataset.
Here, you will select three plots from all of your previous exploration to
present here as a summary of some of your most interesting findings. Make sure
that you have refined your selected plots for good titling, axis labels (with
units), and good aesthetic choices (e.g. color, transparency). After each plot,
make sure you justify why you chose each plot by describing what it shows.

### Plot One :Effect of alcohol on wine quality
```{r echo=FALSE, Plot_One}
ggplot(data = rw, aes(as.factor(quality), alcohol, fill = rating)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  ggtitle('Alcohol Levels on Wine Quality') +
  xlab('Quality') +
  ylab('Alcohol (% volume)') +
  scale_fill_brewer(type = 'seq', palette = 1)
```

### Description One
As alcohol is highly correlated with the quality, it is better to see its pattern with varying rating. From the above plot, it clearly shows higher % of alcohol yields better wine.

### Plot Two :Effect of acids on wine quality 

```{r echo=FALSE, Plot_Two}
grid.arrange(ggplot(data = rw, aes(as.factor(quality), fixed.acidity, fill = rating)) +
               geom_boxplot() +
               xlab("Quality") +
               ylab("Fixed Acidity (g / dm^3)") +
              scale_fill_brewer(type = 'seq', palette = 1),
             ggplot(data = rw, aes(as.factor(quality), volatile.acidity, fill = rating)) +
               geom_boxplot() +
               xlab("Quality") +
               ylab("Volatile Acidity (g / dm^3)") +
              scale_fill_brewer(type = 'seq', palette = 1),
             ggplot(data = rw, aes(as.factor(quality), citric.acid, fill = rating)) +
               geom_boxplot() +
               xlab("Quality") +
               ylab("Citric Acid (g / dm^3)") +
              scale_fill_brewer(type = 'seq', palette = 1),
             ncol = 1)
```

### Description Two
As more the acidic better is the wine. It would be better to see which acids have more impact on wine quality. Above plot shows, fixed.acidity and citric.acid have highly correlated with quality but volatile.acidity has negative impact on quality.

### Plot Three : Ideal vs poor wine
```{r echo=FALSE, Plot_Three}
ggplot(data = subset(rw, rating != 'good'), aes(alcohol, sulphates, color = rating)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle('Alcohol vs Sulphates on Wine Quality') +
  xlab('Sulphates (g / dm^3)') +
  ylab('Alcohol (% volume)')
```

### Description Three
It would be great to see the real pattern between good and bad wines. Above plot differentiate between good and bad wines. It shows higher the % of alcohol and higher the sulphates give better wines.

# Reflection
So, there are lots of features on which the wine quality is depend. We do a lot to find the relationship between every variables in the dataset, try to get some linear relation using geom_smooth().
And, after this EDA, I can conclude that the major factors for better wine quality is alcohol, acidity and sulphates. These features must also be in required content otherwise negative impact will effect the wine quality. Also, we can't be totally sure about quality index also it has been taken by some experts. We've also concluded that there is linear relationship between pH and quality with negative slope.

One thing that is still unclear is the amount of residual.sugar. It contains many outliers, also after doing some operation we get its common range from 1 to 4. But we can't find its amount for ideal wine quality. I think more future research need to be done to find its ideal quantity.
